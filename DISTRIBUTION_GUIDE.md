Let me know if you have any questions!
```

## 🔍 What Recipients Need

### Must Have:
- **macOS** (10.13 or later)
- **Node.js v16+** (preferably v18+)
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
  - Install the LTS version

### Automatic (Handled by Launcher):
- ✅ npm (comes with Node.js)
- ✅ All dependencies (auto-installed)
- ✅ Build process (automatic)
- ✅ Electron (included in dependencies)

---

## 🖥️ Electron vs Browser - Key Points

### ✅ It Runs in Electron (Desktop App)
Your recipients will get a **native desktop application**, NOT a website:

**Electron is like:**
- Slack (desktop app)
- VS Code (desktop app)
- Discord (desktop app)
- Spotify desktop app

**Electron is NOT:**
- localhost:3000 (web server)
- Chrome browser window
- Safari/Firefox
- A website

### Why Electron?
1. **Better Performance**: 8GB memory vs 2GB in browsers
2. **Handles Large Data**: 10,000+ threads without crash
3. **Desktop Experience**: Native app feel
4. **No Browser Tabs**: Standalone window
5. **Data Security**: All local, no internet needed

### Technical Details
- Electron = Chromium (Chrome's engine) + Node.js
- It HAS DevTools (because it uses Chromium)
- But it's a packaged desktop app, not a web server
- Runs locally, no internet required

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

When someone runs your ZIP:

✅ **100% Local Execution**
- No data sent to internet
- All processing on their computer

3. **View conversation details** with full message history
4. **Save favorite conversations** for later review
5. **Generate statistics** and analytics
6. **Search by conversation ID**
7. **Filter by tools, workflows, topics**

All in a fast, responsive desktop application!

## 🚀 Performance Benefits

**Result:** Can analyze 10,000+ threads without lag or crashes.

## 🆘 Support / Common Questions

### "Do they need to install anything?"
**Just Node.js.** Everything else is automatic.

### "Does it run in Chrome/Safari?"
**No.** It's a desktop app (Electron), not a website.

### "Do they need localhost:3000?"
**No.** Not a web server. It's a standalone desktop application.

### "Does it require internet?"
**Only for initial dependency install.** After that, works completely offline.

### "Can they modify the code?"
**Yes!** All source code is included. They can customize if needed.

### "Is my data safe?"
**100% safe.** All data stays on their local computer. Nothing sent externally.

### "Will it work on Windows?"
The current launcher is macOS-only. For Windows, you'd need to:
- Create a `.bat` file (similar to the `.command` file)
- Or guide them to run: `npm install && npm run build && npm start`

### "Will it work on Linux?"
Yes! The launcher script works on Linux. Just make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x TheBot-Dashboard.command
./TheBot-Dashboard.command
```
